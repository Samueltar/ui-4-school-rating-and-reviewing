   is a platform designed for both mobile and web users to rate and review schools. Created in Figma, the design offers a responsive and user-friendly experience, allowing students, parents, and teachers to evaluate schools based on key factors such as academics, cleanliness, facilities, and staff. The interface includes intuitive features like school listings with average ratings, a review submission form with star ratings, and sorting options for reviews. The high-level design ensures a clean, consistent layout, while the low-level design focuses on clear components like buttons, input fields, and validation messages, making the process of submitting and viewing reviews seamless across both platforms.
